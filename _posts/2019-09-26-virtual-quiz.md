I first learned of the Virtual Quiz application during fall of my freshman year - in fact I had agreed to be in charge of the project. At that time it was written in Visual Basic, and while it certainly did the job, there were a lot of technical issues that had to be resolved every year we ran it. During the summer, before I went to Russia to study, I decided that I would do what I could to make the application more accessible and easy to use. I figured the easiest thing for schools to use would be a web app. Therefore, I decided to learn a new and upcoming framework, Angular 2. At the time it was only a release candidate but based on the success of the prior AngularJS, and its backing by Google, I figured it would be worth learning.

For the backend, I learned that using NodeJS with Express a standard way to put together a backend. This was the first time I had put together a full-stack application using a REST API. I also had heard of MongoDB and Heroku before, and so I used MongoDB to store our data and Heroku to host the web application.

It was that summer and the following fall that that the first iteration of the redesigned app came to fruition. It was messy, code-wise, as a lot of best practice for Angular 2 hadn’t been developed yet, but it was functional, and by the time of the next competition, next spring, it was ready.
 
Since then, I’ve made fairly major changes to it every year, including one rewrite, improved the code, and the functionality of the program. My latest addition is an admin interface that allows other people to more easily manage the administrative functionality of the program - since I will no longer be around to help. 

It's my most interesting project as it has evolved along with me. For example, when I learned about async-await functions in Javascript in one of my classes, I quickly began considering ways that I could apply them to my backend to help clean up the code.

It's changed a lot over the years and it's one of my most impactful projects thus far, as it finds use every year as a essential fundraising activity for the Iowa State Quizbowl Club.
