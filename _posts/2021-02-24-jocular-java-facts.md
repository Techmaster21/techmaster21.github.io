Hello and welcome to the inaugural release of Ajâ€™s Joculuar Java facts, so called because itâ€™s alliterative, not necessarily because itâ€™s funny.

What do you think is the result of `Math.abs(-2147483648)` ? No, itâ€™s not actually `2147483648`, itâ€™s `-2147483648`!!! This is the only negative integer for which Math.abs does not return a positive, and itâ€™s because of twosâ€™ complement and 0. The short version is, twosâ€™ compliment is the most common way that computers store negative numbers, and because it makes use of every bit, while not wasting any, and because it needs a way to represent 0, there actually ends up being one more negative than there are positives. This is why the max integer is `2147483647` but the minimum integer is `-2147483648`! And because `2147483648` doesnâ€™t fit in an integer (itâ€™s one bigger than the max), the designers had to make a choice: either `Math.abs(int)` has to return a `long` or bigger, or the minimum integer has to be treated differently. 

There is actually a way of representing negative numbers that is less common called onesâ€™ compliment. It doesnâ€™t have this problem, because the number of positive and negative numbers are the same. The downside? It has two 0s, positive and negative ðŸ˜±.
